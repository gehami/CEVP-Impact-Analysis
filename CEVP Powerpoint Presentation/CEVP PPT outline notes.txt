So the presentation is "about" the great things that CEVP has done for reducing Fire travel time. But the presentation is really about how fluid and easy this process was thanks to an established, verifiable, protocol for data collection. That the data is collected extensively, that we are comfortable sharing the data within the City, that we are able to negotiate what goes public and what stays with us. This presentation is really about the process for data collection, sharing, and analysis that should be standard in the City. Even just this one dataset has the potential to give us so much information, and address so many problems. [Show the network of Fire trips within 4 minute range]. With the same data used for this analysis we can identify all the areas in the City where Fire can reach in 4 minutes, and the areas that they can't. Becuase CEVP is great, but it's not nearly enough to reach the 4 minute mark we want. Which isn't to say that the 4 minute mark isn't possible. If we look at this data, we can see the effective range of our units. Through the same data, we can see where we should put substations. It's the same data, but because it is clean, accurate, and there is a lot of it, we can do so much with it.
